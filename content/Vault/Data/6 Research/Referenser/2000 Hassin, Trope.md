# Facing Faces: Studies on the Cognitive Aspects of Physiognomy

Studie som undersökte [[Ansiktsuppfattning]] genom att se hur människor påverkas av ansikten med olika information. Ger bland annat flera olika ansiktsegenskaper som påverkas av olika information. Fann bland annat att fysionomikprocessen människor har är automatiskt. Tar upp forskning som anser att [[Fysionomik är en pseudovetenskap]].

> It is argued, however, that the process of “reading from faces” is just one side of the coin, the other side which is “reading into faces”.

> 75% of the Israeli population believes in physiognomy.

> Considerable experimental evidence suggests that people can and do infer personality traits from faces. [...] Taken as a whole, this research shows that the process of inferring traits from faces is highly reliable. That is, different judges tend to infersimilar traits from given faces. Some studies [...] even take this direction one step further, showing that this interjudge agreement is crosscultural, thus suggesting that the cognitive work of reading traits from faces has some universal characteristics.

> Om validitet: Most of the earlier studies that examined this question concluded that there is no significant correlation between facial features or physiognomic inferences and the traits individuals actually possess.

> Instead, the arguments presented above regarding the availability, stability, and uncontrollability of faces lead us to hypothesize that physiognomy is an integral part of social cognition, and to further hypothesize two general roles faces may play in it.

> The more ambiguous this information is, the more perceivers use the face.

> Even when asked to, perceivers are unable to ignore people’s faces [...] although they are quite sure that are able to do so.

> We are trapped in our faces, because controlled processes are very demanding, and even when these demands are met, controlled processes are not always capable of saving us from our faces. [...] Strong verbal information changes the perception of the face.

2.  Available personality data (RIF: reading into faces)
