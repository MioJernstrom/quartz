If they are stereotypes, they are stillborn.

Handbok f√∂r spelutveckling och hur man kan utveckla karakt√§rer och narrativ i spel. Diskuterar [[Stereotyper och f√∂rdomar|stereotyper]] och hur man b√∂r f√∂rh√•lla sig till dem. Definierar stereotyper som:
```ad-A1
Stereotype: a generalized, non-contextual portrait of an individual that does not take into account unique qualities all individuals possess.
```
S√§ger att en stereotyper generellt arbetar emot narrativets trov√§rdighet. En stereotypad karakt√§r √§r inte en respekterad karakt√§r utan snarare endast ett verktyg f√∂r utvecklarna vilket h√§mmar spelarens upplevelse. S√§ger att stereotyper i media √§r inte lika illa som i verkligheten, och n√§mner att stereotyper √§r enkla att skriva och till och med f√∂rv√§ntas att dyka upp i vissa genrer. P√•pekar dock att detta √§r inte bra urs√§kter eftersom resultatet blir en-dimensionella karakt√§rer. 

En metod om man vill anv√§nda sig av igenk√§nnbara karakt√§rstyper och arketyper utan att g√∂ra dem stereotypa √§r att ge ett attribut till karakt√§ren som mots√§ger stereotypen.

## Citat

"(W)e expect certain stereotpycal types of characters. We need to recognize this as not being a license to write stereotypes. Instead, the skillful author should bring them to better than one-dimensional life. (...) Learning the conventions of the genre and respecting them is a sure sign of an experienced professional writer." - s.350

"All stereotypes may start with a grain of truth(...) But it is a stereotype, and therefore no more valid an observation than all actors are immorral or all writers drink way too much bourbon." -s. 240

"A stereotyped character is not a respected character. It is a tool of the author, the artist, the marketing department, or all three." - s.38

"Recognicable character types or personalities (...) serve as a shorthard readable by the player. (...) These can easily become stereotypes if we're not careful enough. The trick is to then give the character some attitude that will rescue her from the clutches of stereotype. - s.54

"Take a profession or race or physical trait and, thanks to centuries of character-creation, almost immediately a personality trait pops into your mind. These are stereotypes. (...) Relying on them in narrative fiction is not as bad as in real life where failing to see the real person behind a stereotype can harm a relationship, even with a stranger, prevent communication, or even be dangerous. There may be cases where deliberate stereotyping to make a point is even advantegous in fiction. But for the most part, stereotypes work against the veracity of the narrative. Since they are so common, we don't notice them, or take them for granted, particularly because they appear to be staples of most genre fiction, and stories in games are, without exception, genre fiction.

(...) But what excuses might a writer, someone hopefully a bit more wordly and open-minded, have? There are several.

**We don't realize they are stereotypes.** (...) **Stereotypes are easy to write.** All the work has been done for us. (...) **We may justify their inclusing by citing time constrait.** (...) **Stereotypes are often confused with archetypes.** Arechetypes are universally recognized. Men want the chance to interact with goddesses in leather. Women want to team up with dashing, romantic men who will sweep them off their feet, or succumb to their charms. We want men and women to play our games, to live out their fantasies, sure, but unless we turn htose fantasies into living, breathing individuals, the experience will be hollow. (...) **Some types or games, like RPGs, rely on them for their player-character creaton**. Payers want to play the stealthy rogue, the benevolent cleric, the elven archer. Since these characters are developed very mechanically *on purpose*, they should occupy a special exception to the rule. The largest problem with your game in this case may not lie with stereotyped characters at all, but the stereotypical setting you want them to live in."

"Falling back on stereotypes is certainly easier than finding new characters either in life or
in our imaginations. Certainly some of the appeal in RPGs is allowing the players to
assume roles more glamorous and enviable than we might play in life. But stereotypes
diminish the overall gaming experience. They limit the sophistication of our stories. And
as a result, limit our audience. Try to catch yourself doing it. Take the extra time and struggle to avoid stereotypes. To recognize when you are writing stereotypes, ask yourself questions: Does the character look, talk, and act exactly as you‚Äôd expect her to? If there are no surprises, you‚Äôve got a stereotype. Do the concept sketches the artists are making from your description look a lot like the concept sketches from other games? Stereotype."

"Learning the conventions of the genre and respecting them is a sure sign of an 
experienced professional writer." - s.350

"A well written character doesn't have to explain himself. He may not even know how. He is revealed by what he chooses to do." - .s40
