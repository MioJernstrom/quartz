## Identifying personality from the static, nonexpressive face in humans and chimpanzees: evidence of a shared system for signaling personality

Refereras av [[2016 Qin, Gao, Xu, Hu]], uppfÃ¶ljningsstudie till [[2010 Kramer Ward]]. Resultaten visar att [[MÃ¤nniskor kan korrekt avgÃ¶ra vissa egenskaper baserat pÃ¥ utseende]], Ã¤ven hos chimpanser.


> ==Many aspects of personality are honestly signaled on the human face, as shown by accurate identification of personality traits from static images of unknown faces with neutral expressions.== Here, we examined the evolutionary history of this signal system. In four studies, we found that ==untrained human observers reliably discriminated characteristics related to extraversion solely from nonexpressive facial images of chimpanzees== (Pan troglodytes). In chimpanzees, as in humans, ==there is therefore information in the static, nonexpressive face that signals aspects of an individual's personality==. We suggest that this performance is best explained by shared personality structure and signaling in the two species.
