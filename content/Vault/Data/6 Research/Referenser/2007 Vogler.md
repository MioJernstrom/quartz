>As soon as you enter the world of fairy tales and myths, you become aware of recurring character types and relationships. [...] In describing these common character types, symbols, and relationships the Swiss psychologist Carl G. Jung employed the term archetypes, meaning ancient patterns of personality that are the shared heritage of the human race. (Archetypes are) not ... rigid character roles but as functions performed temporarily by characters to achieve certain effects in a story. ... The archetypes can be thought of as masks, worn by the characters temporarily as they are needed to advance the story.
