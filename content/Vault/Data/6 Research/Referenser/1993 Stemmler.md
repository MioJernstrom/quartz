# The Physiognomical Portraits of Johann Caspar Lavater
Redogör för att [[Lavater hade ett stort inflytande på fysionomik]] och [[Fysionomi#Historia|fysionomikens historia]], specifikt hur Lavater's ord har ofta förvrängts i översättnignar för att sprida översättarens åsikter. Försöker därför återgå till specifikt Lavaters egna åsikter.

> The most popular English translation, that by Thomas Holcroft, reflects the views of Holcroft, a man characterized as a skeptic and atheist, an idealist who wanted to rearrange the world, and a careless and hasty translator. [...] Thus, today’s researchers who relies on Holcroft cannot fully understand Lavater’s position.

> He himself did not propose a universal system.

> Lavater expanded the definition of language to include the idea that human physiognomy is or was a form of wordless speech.

> The natural and essential bony skull and its carefully measured proportions are the true indicators of the character of man, whereas the face and the flesh are the accidentals.

> In Lavater’s view, it follows that the bones of one’s skull, soft at first, are continually worked upon from the inside by the developing brain and from the outside by the muscles, those expressers of the passion.

> “In order to prosecute with advantage the study of Physiognomy, it is necessary to begin with silhouettes... [which] are very exact.” [...] For Lavater, the silhouette was of “all portraits the feeblest and least finished but justest and most faithful”.

> We must certianly learn to become more aware of the putative transparency of the visual image and its power in a world increasingly dominated and interpreted through potent images.
