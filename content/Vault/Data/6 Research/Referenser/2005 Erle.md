# Face to Face with Johann Caspar Lavater

GÃ¥r igenom att [[Lavater hade ett stort inflytande pÃ¥ fysionomik]] och [[Fysionomi#Historia|fysionomikens historia]].

> Studies of Lavater and physiognomy have concentrated mostly on how character portraiture is sustained by physical description.

> His greatest legacy, though, is not in art or theology as Lavater himself might have expected, but in literature.

> Its many engraved portraits sought to codify what was beautiful, ugly, wise or foolish in facial expression.

> Bone shapes, according to Lavater, explained the relationship between outer form and inner character.
